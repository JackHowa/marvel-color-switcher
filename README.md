# Marvel Color Switcher

- Inspired by https://epicreact.dev/css-variables/ (code sandbox https://df90h.csb.app/)

## pt 1 Goals

- [x] Click to switch between characters
- [x] Change color on character switch using CSS Variables
- [x] Change content as well without url change of character bio
- [ ] Maybe change font and other styles as well
- [x] Make sure color contrast of wild marvel colors are still accessible with Google Material Color picker ;) -> somewhat better with lighthouse

## pt form picker react-hook-form context

- [ ] Update button using v7 of react-hook-form
- [ ] Use form context to submit the form change separate from the inputs (mostly unnecessary but poc)

## Reach Goals

- [ ] IE 11 does not support CSS Variables, but think of a way?
- [ ] Create your own color scheme and make your own character live
- [ ] Add other custom styles like font-height but whatever
- [ ] Do something about data of who picks what
