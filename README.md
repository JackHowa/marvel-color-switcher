# Marvel Color Switcher

- Inspired by https://epicreact.dev/css-variables/

## pt 1 Goals

- [ ] Click to switch between characters
- [ ] Change color on character switch using CSS Variables
- [ ] Change content as well without url change of character bio
- [ ] Maybe change font and other styles as well
- [ ] Make sure color contrast of wild marvel colors are still accessible with Google Material Color picker ;)

## Reach Goals

- [ ] IE 11 does not support CSS Variables, but think of a way?
- [ ] Create your own color scheme and make your own character live
- [ ] Add other custom styles like font-height but whatever
- [ ] Do something about data of who picks what
