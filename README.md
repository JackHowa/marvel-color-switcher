- [x] Make sure color contrast of wild marvel colors are still accessible with Google Material Color picker ;) -> somewhat better with lighthouse

## pt form picker react-hook-form context

- [x] Update button using v7 of react-hook-form
- [x] Use form context to submit the form change separate from the inputs (mostly unnecessary but poc)
